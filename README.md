# tiny_json_parser

A tiny (small LOC, binary size) JSON parser written in Rust with no dependencies. Suitable for embedded and resource-constrained environments with high reliability requirements: No std, no allocation, no panics and no unsafe. We strive for high code quality and thorough testing and fuzzing.
